# FileShare
Open Source File Sharing app for android devices.

I share files between devices constantly without cables but: 
 - Most of the available solutions won't work on my old devices.
 - They had many features that I didn't need, it was a bloated experience.
 - Too many intrusive ads.

## Features
 - No internet connection required, it uses the current WiFi connection.
 - Add as many files as you want to the queue.
 - Dark mode and simple design.
